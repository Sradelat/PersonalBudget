# My Personal Budget Calculator
*Project complete but will need updates. It's all for my wife.*

This project is for practical personal use, but it is also a display of my work.

### What is it?
It's a budget calculator. Designed to read CSV files that can be downloaded
from the bank and credit card websites that we (my wife and I) use. My wife
does the budgeting but this will help her be more efficient.

### What problem does this solve?
My wife calculates each transaction on a calculator and writes it onto paper.
This is slow and requires quite a bit of focus.

### What is the goal of this program?
- Calculate each transaction automatically
- Easily separate transaction amounts into categories (Food, Gas, ect.)
- Populate values and categories into a spreadsheet
- Create a pie graph using the resulting data

### User quality of life additions:
- Add category command - adds a custom category
- Delete category command - deletes a category but not before checking if it has a value
- Return command - marks a transaction as a money back return and is directed to a category
- Split command - splits a transactions total in order to divide into more than one category
- Totals command - shows running totals of each category
- Help command - shows user format and description of each command
