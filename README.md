# My Personal Budget Calculator
*Work in progress! It's actually for my wife.*

This project is for practical personal use, but it is also a display of my work.

### What is it?
It's a budget calculator. Designed to read CSV files that can be downloaded
from the bank and credit card websites that we (my wife and I) use. My wife
does the budgeting but this will help her be more efficient.

### What problem does this solve?
My wife calculates each transaction on a calculator and writes it onto paper.
This is slow and requires quite a bit of focus.

### What is the goal of this program?
- Calculate each transaction automatically
- Easily separate transaction amounts into categories (Food, Gas, ect.)
- Populate values and categories into a spreadsheet
- Create graphs using the resulting data (ambition!)
